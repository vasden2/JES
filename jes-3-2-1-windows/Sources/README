to build java class files and javadocs:
    # both of these commands should be run in the jes-<version>/Sources directory
    > javac *.java
    > javadoc *.java -d javadoc

to build a distribution:
    # these instructions will build a zipfile distribution suitable for release as either a stable or development package
    # variables are in denoted as <var> and should be replaced with the appropriate value
    # optional arguments are placed in brackets such as [-o opt]

    # set the environment variable JES_SVNROOT to save some typing later
    > export JES_SVNROOT=svn+ssh://triton.cc.gatech.edu/hm20/jes/jes-svnroot/jes
    
    # export the code for a particular revision (or HEAD) to your current working directory
    > svn export [-r <revision>] $JES_SVNROOT/trunk jes-<version>
    
    # tag the revision (or HEAD) with a version number
    > svn copy [-r <revision>] $JES_SVNROOT/trunk $JES_SVNROOT/tags/release-<version> -m "Tagging <revision> as <version>"
    
    # build the code and generate the javadocs
    > cd jes-<version>/Sources
    > javac *.java
    > javadoc *.java -d javadoc
    launch JES (both to test and to autobuild the class files)
    move to the directory containing jes-<version>

    # create the distribution zipfile
    > zip -r jes-<version> jes-<version>
    move zipfile into triton:/var/www/html/jes/dist/
    update trac release page
